About
--------

Nginx snmp is a nginx addon,which can get backend servers' performance data by SNMP,
and controlling new HTTP requests redirect.If the performance data of a backend server  more(or 
less) a specified value,then the addon dening a new HTTP request redirected the backend server,
and log a warning message into error log.If the performance data of all backend servers in a 
upstream group, then the addon dening all new HTTP requests redirected the backend servers,and 
redirect the requests to a specified URL(or URI) or sending a response message with specified 
message to the client(according to the configuration).This addon can prevent the backend servers
from down in high concurrency.

Install
